    a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance 
    of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables 
    and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
